Welcome to Bloodmage Software, where we breathe new life into retro-style gaming experiences! Our studio is dedicated to crafting captivating story adventure games that harken back to the golden era of gaming while infusing them with fresh narratives and innovative gameplay mechanics.

At Bloodmage Software, we take pride in our unique approach to game development. Unlike traditional game studios, we eschew popular game engines like Unreal or Unity in favor of our own proprietary technology built on Raylib. Raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library for creating games and multimedia applications, providing us with the flexibility and control needed to bring our creative visions to life.

But that's not all—our games are not only crafted with passion but also with a commitment to open source principles. Every line of code behind our games is freely available for exploration and modification by the community, fostering collaboration and creativity among developers and gamers alike.

Behind the scenes, our games are powered by Golang, a powerful and efficient programming language known for its simplicity, concurrency support, and robust standard library. With Golang at our disposal, we're able to write clean, concise, and performant code that forms the backbone of our immersive gaming experiences.

Join us on our journey as we continue to push the boundaries of retro-style gaming, blending nostalgia with innovation to create unforgettable adventures for players old and new. Welcome to Bloodmage Software — where the magic of gaming lives on!
