**Who Are We?**
Bloodmage Software is an open source organization on GitHub dedicated to building software that takes you into immersive worlds.

**Our Mission**
Our mission is simple: to bridge the gap between the nostalgia of old-school RPGs and the innovation of modern software development.
We believe in crafting tools and games that empower creators and transport players to imaginative worlds.
With a strong emphasis on performance and usability, we're determined to provide the best experiences to both developers and gamers alike.

**What Sets Us Apart**
1. **Go-Powered Game Engines:** We're breaking the mold by developing game engines in Go, offering a unique, high-performance alternative to traditional C++ and C# engines.
2. **Old Meets New:** Our projects draw inspiration from classic RPGs, infusing them with modern game design and technology.
3. **Open Source:** We're firm believers in the open-source ethos, encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing among developers.

**Our Current Project**
We're excited to announce that our current focus is on building a game engine that not only meets the demands of modern game development but does so with the power of Go. This game engine aims to be the ultimate tool for indie developers and hobbyists who want to create immersive role-playing experiences.
